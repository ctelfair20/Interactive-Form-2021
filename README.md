# Interactive-Form-2021
 In this project, I used vanilla JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form built with HTML and CSS for a fictional Full Stack conference complete with input validation and helpful real-time error messages to improve accessibility.

 In order for the form to be submitted:
  - the name section must not be blank and the first name must be capitalized
    - if you do not capitalize the first name, you will receive a error message 

  - the email section must be formatted correctly 
    - every server name is acceptable
    - the domain must be .com
    - if the domain is missing, you will receive a error message

  - at least one activity must be selected 
    - you will not be allowed to select two classes that occur at the same time on the same day
    - if no activity is selected, you will receive an error message

  - the credit card section must contain a card number, a CVV number and a zip code with the appropriate amount of numbers 
    - 12-16 for the card number
    - 5 for the zip code
    - 3 for the CVV
